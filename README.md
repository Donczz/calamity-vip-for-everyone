Calamity.vip For Everyone is a project aimed at providing Calamity.vip to everyone no waiting for cat to release involved.

I forgor to mention it's outdated, so the only way you can use it is by bytepatching and hex editing 💀. You could still probably get this working faster than it being officially released (lol) altough i cant see why anyone would bother

Note: 
cat, no hate to you, if you do somehow find this repo and want it taken down, dm me on discord and we can get things sorted out, since im not trying to get into trouble or anything 👍
